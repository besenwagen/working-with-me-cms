## Who is you?

Hi! I'm Lydia. I'm a **senior product designer** on the design team here at Netlify.

I'm based in Berkeley, CA and I usually work **7am-3pm PST.**

I have 12-3pm blocked for "Focus Time" most days to do heads-down work, but it's not firm ‚Äì feel free to message me during and schedule a meeting if other morning times don't work.

I'm an Aries ‚ôà and a [Type 7](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7) ("The Enthusiast") ‚Äì this is an oversimplification of my personality, but some of it rings true!

The good: I'm optimistic, enthusiastic, and game to start things and get others to join.

The not-so-good: Hate to say it, but follow-through can sometimes be a challenge üò¨ (because I get so excited about the start of things and working on many things) ‚Äì I work to be aware and stay ahead of this, but please call me out if I have dropped a ball üèÄ

I'm on the Continuous Onboarding/Growth pod: **Team Rocket** [üöÄ](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)

I previously worked on the growth team at Dropbox (focused on activation and retention), for a couple startups in education and construction, and at a consultancy called thoughtbot.

## What do you like to do and what are you best at doing?

Partnering with product to explore the "why" and the strategy behind things, to develop the concept.

Generating ideas (and leading design thinking sessions) with other designers and cross-functional peers.

Working with different disciplines ‚Äì product, data analysts, engineers, and more!

Working on things that are important to customers and good for the business.

Working with research and talking to customers.

I get energy from working on a variety of activities, with a split between heads-down and collaboration time.

Tinkering in Figma and learning new things from my design teammates (recently learned how to make component variants)!

Working with developers to bring designs to life (I used to do some front-end development at thoughtbot, though I definitely hit a wall when learning javascript and prefer sticking to the html and css! Coding is hard).

## What do you like to do but want to get better at doing?

I love illustration and would like to get better at it.

## What are you not as good at doing or not like doing as much?

Animation and complex prototyping ‚Äì but perhaps I should try to learn and get better!

Coding beyond html and css (halp)

I rely on data to make decisions, but doing quantitative analysis is not my strong suit, so I appreciate when the data team and product managers can help clarify the significance of a trend.

## Any pet peeves?

Prefer not to work on things that don't seem to be important to customers or the business!

"Overdocumenting" design beyond the developers' need (like redlining pixels if a component is already in the design system, for example)

My ideal way of working is collaborative, so I can feel left out if not involved in the design thinking and problem definition phase (the "why" behind a thing) and *only* doing execution...though in some cases this can be necessary!

## Anything else?

I enjoy being silly and lightening the mood ‚Äì please don‚Äôt mistake that for a lack of seriousness about work!

I can be self-deprecating, and I am game to change directions when it makes sense, but don't mistake this flexibility for a lack of confidence/conviction in my designs!

I am open to feedback ‚Äì I‚Äôd love to know how what I‚Äôm doing is working or not working. Don‚Äôt hesitate to share with me anything positive or critical. I know we respect each other, so I welcome it!

I studied Art History and love art. I lived in Rome briefly in college, and going to museums was my jam:
